This environment has been configured with varnish.

Varnish listens IN FRONT of haproxy, although both applications listen on port 80.

Currently iptables is being used to take incomming traffic from <%= @interface %>:80
and redirecting it to port 882.  Varnish is then connecting to HAProxy via 127.0.0.1:80.

If you can curl localhost:80 but cannot connect to port 80 remotely there is an issue
with varnish.  Varnish is currently monitored by monit.
