------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A chef recipe for enabling Postgres extensions (contribs on Postgres 9.0) packages on Engine Yard Cloud.  This recipe defines multiple methods that
can be called from main/recipes/default.rb to enable extensions for a given database.


Dependencies
--------------------------
You need to have an instance running Postgres 9.0 or above to apply these recipes.


Available Extensions
--------------------------
At the moment the following extensions are available.

##auto_explain
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2
This extension provides a means for logging execution plans of slow statements automatically, without having to run EXPLAIN by hand.
This is especially helpful for tracking down un-optimized queries in large applications.
WARNING: Enabling this extension will restart your Postgres service.

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

``postgresql9_autoexplain "dbname""``

##btree_gin
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2
This extension provides support for indexing common datatypes in GIN

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

``postgresql9_btree_gin "dbname""``

##intarray
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1
The intarray module provides a number of useful functions and operators for manipulating null-free arrays of integers. There is also support for indexed searches using some of the operators.

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

``postgresql9_intarray "dbname""``


##btree_gist
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2
This extension provides support for indexing common datatypes in GiST

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

``postgresql9_btree_gist "dbname""``


##chkpass
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2

to encrypted form upon entry, and is always stored encrypted.

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

``postgresql9_chkpass "dbname""``


##citext
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2

Otherwise, it behaves almost exactly like text. (This is great for MySQL compatibility which does text comparisons case-insensitive, by default)

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

``postgresql9_citext "dbname""``


##cube
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2

##dict_int
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2
dict_int is an example of an add-on dictionary template for full-text search. The motivation for this example dictionary is to control the indexing of integers (signed and unsigned), allowing such numbers to be indexed while preventing excessive growth in the number of unique words, which greatly affects the performance of searching.

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.

``postgresql9_dict_xsyn "dbname""``


##earthdistance
###supported versions: 9.0, 9.1, 9.2
The earthdistance module provides two different approaches to calculating great circle distances on the surface of the Earth.

Enabling this extension:

* Edit main/recipes/default.rb and comment out the line shown below. Replace dbname with the name of the database you want this
extension applied to.
